Prosthetics go beyond their traditional function. They are not tools to fix or replace, but extensions that question how we evolve.

BookGrip is a prosthesis that forces the body to hold a book again, to pause, to feel its weight, and to reconnect with knowledge through touch.
It reminds us that being the best version of ourselves isn’t always about progress, but about remembering what we’ve forgotten.
