Prosthetics go beyond their traditional function. They are not tools to fix or replace, but extensions that question how we evolve.

BookGrip is a prosthesis that forces the body to hold a book again, to pause, to feel its weight, and to reconnect with knowledge through touch.
It reminds us that being the best version of ourselves isn’t always about progress, but about remembering what we've forgotten.

This prosthesis explores the idea of human–nature connection beyond enhancement.
Made of wires, threads, and branches, it acts as an interface of sensitivity, a network that expands the human body’s perception toward the environment.

It imagines a future where we grow with our surroundings instead of apart from them.
Where technology and nature intertwine, and the body becomes a bridge between both.
