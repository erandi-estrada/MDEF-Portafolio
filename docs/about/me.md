# Erandi Estrada

I’m a product & design practitioner passionate about the intersection of **design, technology and sustainability**. I graduated in Design & Technology and I’m expanding my skills through a Master in Design for Emergent Futures, exploring immersive experiences, biomaterials and human-centred solutions.

I enjoy tackling messy problems and turning early ideas into tangible prototypes. My work combines research-led thinking with hands-on making: from material experiments and physical prototyping to digital flows and interface thinking. I thrive in collaborative, multidisciplinary teams and I love learning through doing.

**What I do:** user-centred product design, prototyping, materials research, and creative systems that consider social and environmental impact.

**Skills & tools:** Fusion 360 · Rhino · SolidWorks · Adobe Creative Suite · CNC / laser / manual fabrication · prototyping with microcontrollers · basic UI/UX workflows
