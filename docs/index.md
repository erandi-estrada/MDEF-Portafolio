# MDEF Projects

Welcome to my journey through the **Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF)**, a program by [Fab Lab Barcelona](https://mdef.fablabbcn.org/) and IAAC.  
This space documents the ideas, experiments, and reflections that shaped my learning process â€” from early prototypes to collective explorations.

Join me as I navigate the projects, collaborations, and discoveries that defined this stage of my path as a designer.
