# MDEF Projects

Welcome to my journey through the **Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF)**, a program by [Fab Lab Barcelona](https://mdef.fablabbcn.org/) and IAAC.  
This space documents the ideas, experiments, and reflections that shaped my learning process â€” from early prototypes to collective explorations.
